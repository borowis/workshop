      "i did not expect to love this movie i like kevin james but i was not excited about this movie based off the tv trailers i d seen honestly the trailers did not do it justice it really is funny and so sweet it had me laughing and teared up in all the right moments the cast is great the story is solid and the fight scenes were done very well  as a fan of mma i was not disappointed henry winkler is genius in this and kevin james probably does his best work to date i cannot even put it into words how much i loved this movie other than im buying the dvd immediately to add to my collection  so you should really download it or buy it too  you likely wo not regret it\n",

      "a friend bought this film out of curiosity watched it and was going to toss it but first asked me if i wanted to see it so i borrowed it i eventually tossed it my first reaction was that it was laughable next reaction it begs for a new flm rating  pwp  or  porn with plot one reviewer here asked where they could get more films like this  try an adult bookstore another reviewer compared it to caligua no comparison production values alone in caligula far outweigh those in shortbus which are weak and mostly nonexistent  even the georgina spelvin the devil in miss jones  had more than shortbus there have always been artists and i use that word loosely here that try to push the envelope when they create their art but mr mitchell does not  robert mapplethorp for example was a brilliant artist mr mitchell is not as far as originallity i would suspect that the context for singing the national anthem might be original but then again it could be borrowed from some legitimate porn film there s nothing really new about this film that has been done before  except  the clutter of hardcore sex in among the ploti will sum up by including a quote from aisha tylerfrom the title i was expecting a film about mentally challenged kids going to school instead it was a film by a mentally challenged filmmaker who should have gone to film school\n",

      "i think this dvd is the lowest i have ever rated anything on amazon  there are a number of reasons im returning this fitness workout and why you should avoid it if you are looking for a good not annoying exercise program  the music is really icky kind of elevatorish instrumental with a beat that does not say cardio workout to me but instead says musak at its worst  if you care about what the music the workout uses sounds like very few of you will like this  the workout actually is a cleverly disguised stepworkout  if you are going to make a step workout then label it as such i was looking for something of a floor dance style cardio and nothing on the packaging led me to believe that this was step aerobics  i have a step tape i love but ca not do it because of knee issues and nervedamage in my foot  so i actually scanned the packaging fairly carefully and saw a picture and description that led me to believe this was a dancetype lower impact workout with weights no problem  after watching the dvd i looked more carefully and saw it says that you have to have a special fanny lifter which is on the back but was not shown in the images and was not described as a step so until i saw it i figured i could improvise whatever the fanny lifter was i was wrongi did see a very tiny print disclaimer about people with weak knees or very out of shape being able to use a shorter platform  i am in pretty good shape but yes weak knees is a big deal  i actually think even if you do not have weak knees yet this workout might make you have them if you do it for long  i needed something with no platform so if this is why you are looking at this instead of a step workout do not buy it  the platform you need to buy for this video is actually quite high also so even if you are a step workout fan make sure you are okay with a very high unstable looking step  it s more a footstool than anything else  it also did not imply that this fanny lifter thing was a pretty much essential part of the workout used on almost every section i looked at  it would be really complicated for you to modify the workout if you tried to do it without a step or fanny lifter  i was annoyed with the fact that i could not fast forward through the dvd credits intro material and other  minutes worth of stuff at the start of the dvd  it seemed like a long time to wait while i was standing there in my workout space  the stuff at the beginning was locked out and you could not skip at all if it was a video i would just not rewind all the way so i could skip that part  but with a dvd you have to watch it every time  when i am ready to work out im sorry but i do not really care who the photographer was  it was a waste of my timei actually ca not comment on the difficulty or lack thereof of the routine because i could not get past these issues and instead put in another dvd the one i mention below  i am entirely too busy to spend that much time on something quite this annoyingi understand that the firm is supposed to provide a great workout for many people and if this works for you and you can skip all these issues fine  but if the above issues are things you too might find irritating i suggest instead of this one the kathy smith  timesaver cardio fat burner dvd amazon asin  bqwe\n",
